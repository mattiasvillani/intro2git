## What Git (and Github) can do for you

-   **Version control** of your code and other files.

-   Allows you to **go back in time**. No more:

    -   Thesis_v1.tex

    -   ThesisFinal.tex

    -   ThesisReallyFinal.tex

    -   ThesisReallyReallyFinal.tex

-   **Development**. Test new code features with branches. Abandon or merge.

-   **Collaboration**. Work on the same code separately and merge later.

-   **Share** code (and show off code) (GitHub)

## Git is part of our culture

## What is version control?

Version control by a thousand folders 🤢

![](figs/VersionControlBad.webp)

Version control the right way 😊 (but initially: 😵 )

![](figs/VersionControl.webp)

-   Commits are well defined chunks of changes.

-   Knows *what* the changes were, *who* did the change, and *when* they were made.

-   Can revert a commit to undo changes.

-   Development in branches that can abandoned or used (merged).

## What is Git?

-   Git was famously created by Linus Torvalds (creator of the Linux kernel) in a couple of weeks.

-   Git is a **decentralized** version control system:

    -   Users have local repository with full offline version control on their computers.

    -   Can push to global repository (on Github) to collaborate with others.

-   Used by \> 90% of developers according to Stack Overflow surveys.

-   Fast

## What is GitHub?

-   Place for hosting repositories online.

-   Collaboration hub. A structured way to propose changes, review code, discuss, and approve before merging.

-   Forks, Issues, Pull request, activity etc.

-   *Github actions* for automated workflows (e.g. test your code on other operating systems)

## Git concepts and commands

![](figs/gitoperations.webp){fig-align="center"}

## Giting started

-   **Download git** from: <https://git-scm.com/download>

-   Make a free **github account**.

-   Basics: work from the terminal:

    -   Linux/Mac: use the system terminal

    -   Windows: use *Git Bash* from: <https://gitforwindows.org/>

-   Convenient: work from [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

-   Serious: Dedicated git software: [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) and more.

## Working with Git in RStudio and VS code

**RStudio**:

-   Make an Rstudio project in your code folder (*myrepo*).

-   A Git tab should appear in the upper left window pane with all the things covered in the live demo.

**VS code**:

-   click the source control icon in the left panel: ![](figs/vscode_sourecontrol.svg){width="24"}

## Github pages

-   Github lets you host webpages on github pages.

-   My web page at [mattiasvillani.com](https://mattiasvillani.com/) is actually hosted on Github. Its adress is really [mattiasvillani.github.io](https://mattiasvillani.github.io/), I pay 20 USD a year for the domain name).

-   My workflow:

    -   Make a Quarto website for a new course/project.

    -   Use Quarto to build the web page.

    -   Push the webpage to a Github repo.

    -   Use Github pages to show the webpage.

    -   (Use Github action to build the webpage automatically when doing a git push)
