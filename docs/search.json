This can be a headache, but basically means that you have to decide for each change, which file “wins”. There are merge tools for this.\nThe file .gitignore (create it in your repo) can be used to decide which files git will ignore (not track). For example *.Rproj or .DS_Store\ngit log shows history (commits)\ngit log --oneline --graph --all gives more info, also on existing branches.\ngit clone git@github.com:mattiasvillani/myrepo.git makes copy (clone) of a repository on github to your current directory.\nYou can fork a github repository, meaning that that github repository is copied to your github with links to the original repository.\nForking is a way to suggest changes to someones code (make a pull request (PR)), which they can then review and hopefully merge into their repository."
